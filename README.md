# Seasons
 GIF quilt web artpiece involving the four seasons
The art piece features a square with four GIFs, representing a window. The four GIFs in the window change up to four times, each time representing one of the four seasons. All the GIFs placed in a way, as someone is looking through a window watching the seasons go by.
The lamp that is placed above the window toggles and changes the lighting. By default the lamp is off, but when toggled on, the lamp lights up and the space around the window becomes dark, representing a lamp during night and day.
